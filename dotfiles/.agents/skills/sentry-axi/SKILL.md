# sentry-axi

Agent-friendly wrapper around the configured Sentry MCP server. Prefer it over raw Sentry MCP calls.

Use the standalone `sentry-axi` binary installed globally by mise. If it is missing, run `mise install --locked`. Node.js 24 or newer is required. Run `sentry-axi setup hooks` only when the user explicitly wants session hooks.

## Workflow

1. Run `sentry-axi` with no arguments to inspect authentication and repository context.
2. If needed, run `sentry-axi auth login`. Never print access tokens or saved OAuth credentials.
3. Bind a Git repository with `sentry-axi init --organization <slug> --project <slug>`. Commands then use `.sentry-project` defaults; pass `--all-projects` only when broad scope is intended.
4. Start with compact search or list commands, then drill into a specific issue, event, trace, replay, profile, or resource.
5. Use `--select <field,...>` to narrow structured results and `--full` only when truncation hides needed content.
6. Binary attachment and snapshot-image commands require `--output <path>`.
7. Before creating or updating Sentry data, confirm the exact target unless the user already requested that mutation. After an uncertain transport failure, inspect the target before retrying.
