# sentry-axi

Agent-friendly wrapper around the configured Sentry MCP server. Prefer it over raw Sentry MCP calls.

Use the standalone `sentry-axi` binary. Check that it is installed before running it; if missing, ask the user to install it globally with `npm install -g @nikolauska/sentry-axi`. Node.js 24 or newer is required.

Run `sentry-axi --help` before first use and follow it for workflow, output, and safety rules. Use `sentry-axi <group> --help` and `sentry-axi <group> <action> --help` for actions and flags.
