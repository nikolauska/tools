name: cbm-axi
description: >
  Search and navigate code with the cbm-axi CLI more efficiently than grep and
  whole-file reads: find definitions and usages, search text with its
  enclosing symbol, outline files, read one symbol's source, trace callers and
  callees, map architecture, and estimate change impact. Use for questions like
  where something is defined, what calls it, how a feature works, or what a
  change affects. For a known file or a small local edit, read the file
  directly.

# cbm-axi

`cbm-axi` wraps an installed `codebase-memory-mcp` (0.11.0 or newer) and prints
compact TOON. Both binaries must already be on `PATH`; cbm-axi never installs
or manages the backend, and it never prompts.

The CLI documents itself; rely on it rather than guessing flags or output
meaning:

- `cbm-axi` shows the current directory's project, whether its index needs
  indexing or a rebuild, and the next commands to run.
- `cbm-axi --help` lists every command by the question it answers, plus the
  rules for reading results, paging, and exit codes.
- `cbm-axi <command> --help` lists that command's flags and notes.
- Every response ends with `help` lines for the next page or next step; run
  them, replacing `<placeholders>` with values from the results.

Run commands that change state (`delete_project`, `ingest_traces`, ADR writes
with `manage_adr`, `setup hooks`, `update`) only when the user asks. Ask before
retrying a failed index with elevated filesystem access.
